# Bellabeat Data Analysis — Applied Data Science & Machine Learning

A machine learning and data analysis project focused on extracting actionable insights from the Bellabeat fitness wearable dataset. This repository demonstrates exploratory data analysis (EDA), time-based feature engineering, pattern detection, and predictive modeling relevant to health analytics and behavioral prediction.

---

## 🚀 Project Summary

Wearable devices generate rich streams of user activity, sleep, and health data. This project explores Bellabeat’s anonymized fitness dataset to:

✔ Uncover trends and user behavior patterns  
✔ Engineer temporal and summary features  
✔ Build predictive models for user outcomes  
✔ Interpret and visualize model insights

It reflects a complete data science workflow from **raw data → modeling → interpretation**, aligned with modern ML and analytics practices.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Bellabeat users generate multiple signals (activity, steps, sleep duration) over time. The challenge is to extract meaningful patterns that support predictions and insights that businesses can act on — such as identifying engagement segments, forecasting activity levels, and understanding behavioral trends.

This project seeks to:

1. Analyze user activity and sleep patterns  
2. Derive features that capture temporal behavior  
3. Build supervised models for classification or prediction  
4. Evaluate models and interpret results for decision support

## 🧠 ML & Analytical Methodology

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize distributions of key behavioral metrics  
- Detect seasonality, activity trends, and user segments  
- Identify missing data patterns and outliers

### 🛠 Feature Engineering
- Temporal aggregation (daily, weekly, monthly summaries)  
- Derived metrics (steps per active minute, sleep quality features)  
- Normalization and scaling for modeling

### 🤖 Predictive Modeling
- Train classification/regression models depending on the target
  (examples: predicting high vs. low user engagement)
- Models used can include:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forests
  - Gradient Boosted Trees

### 📊 Model Evaluation & Interpretation
- Cross-validation for model stability  
- Classification/regression metrics (accuracy, RMSE, AUC, etc.)  
- Feature importance and interpretability for business insights
